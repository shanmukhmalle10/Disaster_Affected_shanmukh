Business Rules to be Implemented:
------------------------------------

Replace missing disaster types with "Unknown"

Convert invalid dates safely

Fill population with median

Missing affected people \& losses → 0

Aggregate total affected people per region

----------------------------------------------

ETL Pipeline Flow:

CSV files (dirty data)
        ↓
Python ETL (Pandas)
  - Deduplication
  - Null handling
  - Business rules
        ↓
MySQL clean tables (DDL + constraints)
        ↓
SQL analytics + Matplotlib dashboards


---------------------------------

Dashboard Problem Statements(Matplotlib):

1. Identify top 5 regions by total affected population.
2. Compare disaster severity distribution by disaster type.
3. Trend of disasters over time (monthly).
4. Economic loss vs affected population scatter plot.
5. Region-wise disaster frequency heatmap.
